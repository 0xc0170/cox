Introduction 
    Shield used for drive motors.
    Full-featured motor control shield that will be able to power many simple to medium-complexity projects.
    2 connections for 5V "hobby" servos connected to the Arduino's high-resolution dedicated timer.

Background
(Optional) Is there any background to this code that may be useful
such as an introduction to the basic ideas presented?


Using the code 
A brief description of how to use the code. The
class names, the methods and properties, any tricks or tips.


Blocks of code should be set as style "Formatted"
like this:
//
// Any source code blocks look like this

Remember to set the Language of your code snippet using the
Language dropdown.


Use the "var" button to to wrap Variable or class names in
<code> tags like this.


Points of Interset

Below is some example code:
void MotorStep(void)
{
    unsigned long i, j;

    xSysCtlClockSet(72000000, (xSYSCTL_OSC_MAIN | xSYSCTL_XTAL_8MHZ));
    xSysCtlDelay(100000);

    MSStepMotorInit(MS_STEPPER_NUM2);
    MSStepsDelaySet(1);
    for(i = 0; i < 50; i++)
    {
	MSStepMotorRun(MS_RUN_FORWARD, 50);
	MSStepMotorStop();
    }
}
