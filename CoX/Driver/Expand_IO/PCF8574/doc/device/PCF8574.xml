    <Description>
   
    The PCF8574 is a silicon CMOS circuit. It provides general purpose remote I/O
    expansion for most microcontroller families via the two-line bidirectional bus
    (I2C-bus).
    The device consists of an 8-bit quasi-bidirectional port and an I2C-bus
    interface.
    The PCF8574 has a low current consumption and includes latched outputs with
    high current drive capability for directly driving LEDs. It also possesses an
    interrupt line (INT) which can be connected to the interrupt logic of the
    microcontroller. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote I/O
    can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data on its ports without
    having to communicate via the I2C-bus. This means that the PCF8574 can remain a
    simple slave device.
