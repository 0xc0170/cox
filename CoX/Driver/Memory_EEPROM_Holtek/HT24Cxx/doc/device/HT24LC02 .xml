    <Description>
    	  The HT24LC02 is a 2K-bit serial read/write non-volatile memory device using the CMOS floating gate process. 
		  Its 2048 bits of memory are organized into 256 words and each word is 8 bits. The device is optimized for use 
		  in many industrial and commercial applications where low power and low voltage operation are essential.
		  Up to eight HT24LC02 devices may be connected to the same two-wire bus. The HT24LC02 is guaranteed 
		  for 1M erase/write cycles and 40-year data retention.
